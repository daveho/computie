Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the footprint for the 74HC253s is too small.  I used the 16SSOP - 4.9mm wide, but the chips are
  actually 6.2mm wide.  I've tried to bend the pins under to solder them instead

- the HALT light should really be labelled RUN, since it's really ~HALT (ie. running)

- the ATA DSACK output needs to be inverted.  The input into the NAND gate should be active-low,
  but the output from the counter is going straight into the NAND input.  I'm going to try
  patching it

- (I think) the reset pin of the CompactFlash socket should be connected to the reset button, to
  ensure the card is reset.  Soft resetting seems unreliable

- there was an issues with the 74HC08 chip's AND gate that combines the address decode lines to
  produce the RAMSEL signal, and the fact that those two traces go underneath the chip is causing
  a lot of problems for debugging.  Never route traces to pins underneath a surface mount chip!
  It turned out the traces were broken just before they entered the pads from underneath the chip.
  I was not able to patch it and instead bypassed the AND gate with a bodge wire from the trace
  from HC138 pin 14 (SEL1) to RAMSEL, which means only 1MB of RAM is accessible

- the extra DTACK input into the NAND gate should be pulled high to disable it, or else it could
  trigger DTACK erroneously
