Revision 2 Errata and Notes
===========================

- I forgot to add the part name silkscreen for the 74LVC1G32 that was added to rev. 2

- 2023-07: This applies to most versions of Computie: If a ribbon cable is attached to the control
  signals header, it will cause the CPU to not work correctly due to issues with DSACK0/1.  A
  larger pull up resistor on those signals should fix the problem (1K was tested)
